# fastify-session-sqlite-store

SQLite session store for [fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify).

- Requires [@mgcrea/fastify-session](https://github.com/mgcrea/fastify-session) to handle sessions.
- Relies on [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3) to interact with sqlite.
- Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking with exported types along the
  library.
